## Pen-And-Paper Roleplaying Game Itemcard Generator

Simple tool for generating item cards when writing Pen-and-paper adventures.

I wrote this tool for me so it isn't very refined or user friedly but maybe someone else can make use of it.

The items are defined in .csv or .yaml files which are used to generate a print ready html file.

### Usage Example
